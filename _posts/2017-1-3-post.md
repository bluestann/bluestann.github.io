I woke up today around 10 which is not early for me to fulfill my schedule. The first 
class of computer vision seemed a bit boring but the content in the future seems fairly useful 
and interesting. Threre are three levels of computer vision. Low level: graphcis enhancement;
Mid level: image or 3d object scanning and reconstruction; high-level: object recognition.

During the breaks, I did two leetcode problems: find the kth largest element, count the number of primes 
less than a target number. The first one I solved it with a straight forward approach, where I sort the list 
by using the built-in function Arrays.sort(), and return the kth largest element. For the second problem, 
I used the brute force approach which exceeded the time limit for the last two test cases. I looked up the hint 
and was introduced with an algorithm called: [Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes)

Overall it was a good start of the quarter, I will try to stick with it.
